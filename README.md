## 📄 <span id="description">Description</span>

Apple Music Artworks Finder is a simple tool designed to fetch high-quality album cover artworks from the Apple iTunes API.

This project was inspired by a tool I used when I was younger. I always admired how its developer managed to provide such a useful service, and I found it truly impressive. Wanting to both recreate it for my own use and improve my skills in web development, I thought this would be a great project to practice working with APIs.

The tool allows users to search for album artworks and retrieve them in high resolution, making it particularly useful for those who wish to restore missing or low-quality album covers in their digital music collection.

## 🎓 <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of working with external APIs, particularly the iTunes API, while keeping the implementation clean and efficient. Throughout this project, I aimed to improve my DOM manipulation skills, practice asynchronous JavaScript (`fetch()` and `async`/`await`), and design a modern and responsive UI.
<br>
Additionally, optimizing the search experience for speed and accuracy was a key focus, ensuring a smooth and seamless user interaction.
