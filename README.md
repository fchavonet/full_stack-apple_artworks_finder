# iTunes Artwork Finder

## Description

iTunes Artwork Finder is a tool designed to fetch high-quality album cover artworks from the Apple iTunes API.

This project was inspired by a tool I used when I was younger. I always admired how its developer managed to provide such a useful service, which I found truly impressive. Wanting to both recreate it for my own use and improve my skills in web development, I thought this would be a great project to practice working with APIs.

The tool allows users to search for album artworks and retrieve them in high resolution, making it ideal for restoring missing or low-quality album covers in their digital music collection.

## Objectives

- Deepen my understanding of working with external APIs, particularly the iTunes API.
- Ensure a clean and efficient implementation.
- Improve my DOM manipulation skills.
- Practice asynchronous JavaScript (`fetch()` and `async`/`await`).
- Design a modern and responsive user interface.
- Optimize the search experience for speed and accuracy.
- Ensure a smooth and seamless user interaction.

## What's Next?

- Implement infinite scrolling with no fetch limit.
- Add optional search filters (e.g., artist, genre...).
- Improve caching for faster repeated searches.
